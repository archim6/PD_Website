This is the mathematics portion of the assignment requirement, and an opportunity to talk about one of my favorite theorems.

Let $L$ be a distributive lattice, $I \subset L$ an ideal, and $D \subset L$ a dual ideal (sometimes called a filter) such that $I \cap D = \emptyset$. Then there exists a prime ideal, $P \subset L$ such that $I \subseteq P$ and $P \cap D = \emptyset$.

<!-- Let $\phi : G \rightarrow H$ be a group homomorphism. Then $\phi (G) \cong G \Big/ \ker(\phi)$. -->
