This is the mathematics portion of the assignment requirement, and an opportunity to talk about one of my favorite theorems.

Let $L$ be a distributive lattice, $I$ an ideal, and $D$ a dual ideal such that $I \bigcap D = \empty$. Then there exists a prime ideal, $P \subseteq L$ such that $I \subseteq P$ and $P \bigcap D = \empty$.

<!--Let $\phi : G \rightarrow H$ be a group homomorphism. Then $\phi (G) \cong G \Big/ \ker(\phi)$.
